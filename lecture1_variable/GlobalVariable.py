# Global Variables
# Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples in the previous pages) are known as global variables.

# Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.


x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()


# The global Keyword
# Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.

# To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
